# REKO Map

A web app map for desktop and mobile helping potional customers to find REKO-rings where they can buy local produce to aid small scale businesses in the Corona crisis, and after!

This is a compilation of data from:
- https://hushallningssallskapet.se/forskning-utveckling/reko/narmsta-reko-ring/
- https://opendata.lantmateriet.se/

## Challenge

This kinda fit under all three challanges. Eating healthy local produce over commercial imported food surely saves lives, helping you to build a better immune system that help you with fighting off for example Corona.

Making the REKO-rings easier to find and listing the produce available to buy could help the local businesses get their produce sold.

REKO is an important community that needs to be saved. Some REKO-rings already see people not picking up deliveries because they are sick or are in a risk group, reducing their income.

## Digital Solution

To aid the discovery and prosperity of REKO-rings I figured this map could be helpful. The idea is to:

  - List REKO-rings and local food nodes to aid discovery
  - List the produce sold in REKO-rings to encourage new customers to paricipate.
  - Present the people behind the local produce, to let the customers get to know them.
