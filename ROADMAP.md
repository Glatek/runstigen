# Roadmap

Here are some suggestions for a future roadmap to make the REKO-app even more useful.

## Facebook login

By integrating with Facebook login we could list REKO-ring groups a user belongs to and provide a nice overview for them of upcoming delivery events.

This should be too hard of an implementation. Authentication and group post could be fetched and orchesterated by a cloud function and served to the client to be displayed.

## Producer pages

Under each REKO-ring we could list all the producers and have them presented with their own page where they personally could explain the love for their craft and so on to inspire and build deeper connections with local customers.

This is not something that can be automated really. But needed to be made on a producer basis through the REKO-ring groups on Facebook; reaching out to them and getting their stories and pictures to present in the app. I suppose most are willing to do so.

## Producer aiding tools

I, myself, participate in the REKO-ring in Arvika sometimes - selling beeswax candle that I mold myself from both my own and imported bees wax. I use a spreadsheet for stock management and order management now. Building customised tools for helping producers keep track of orders and stock suited for the REKO-ring model would be very helpful. Swish is also the most popular payment method in REKO-rings. This could likely be integrated in some way to further ease the REKO-ring management for producers so they could focus on producing instead.
